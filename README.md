Baseball team playoff

1. What is the question you hope to answer?
Baseball team playoff predictor:
We suspect that teams with winning streaks of at least 7 games in May, June and July  AND the highest run differential for the SEASON and lowest Earned Run Average (ERA) in May, June and July will go to the playoffs. Perhaps the one with the best of all three will go to the world series. And the team in the World Series with the best of those three metrics will win. 
We will build a model based on the features outlined above and validate it.

    2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?
I will be using the data from: http://seanlahman.com/ which includes hitorical baseball data stats until 2017

    3. What do you know about the data you're using so far?
The data includes the following:
This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

    4. Why did you choose this topic?
First of all, this topic is fun. Second, it involves the utilization of a big set of data with various manipulations and mathematical models witch will allow me to learn more about data science.
